a:T6f3,
<p>A lightweight but rigorous workflow converts chaos into clarity. Keep the friction proportional to the impact; fast-track the small, scrutinize the large.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Intake:</b> Standardize a request form capturing problem statement, rationale, affected deliverables, urgency, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Require attachments (drawings, user stories, regulations).</li>
  <li><b>Triage:</b> Classify as defect, enhancement, scope gap, or compliance. Apply thresholds for fast-track vs. full analysis. Reject duplicates and out-of-scope ideas early.</li>
  <li><b><a href="/posts/post-9" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-medium" title="How to Price Change Orders (Supplier Perspective)">Impact analysis</a>:</b> Reference baselines (WBS, schedule, budget). Identify dependencies, critical-path effects, resource conflicts, and risks. Provide options (e.g., gold, silver, bronze) with rough-order-of-magnitude estimates and lead-times.</li>
  <li><b>Decision and approvals:</b> Use a clear authority matrix (PM, sponsor, steering committee) with monetary/time thresholds. Capture decisions, conditions, and funding sources. Enable digital sign-offs for speed and auditability.</li>
  <li><b>Implementation and baseline updates:</b> Insert the approved change into plans, update the change log, communicate assignments, and adjust scope, schedule, and budget baselines. Include test plans and definition of done.</li>
  <li><b>Verification and closeout:</b> Confirm deliverables, validate benefits, and ensure documentation completeness. Close risks/actions created by the change.</li>
  <li><b>Governance cadence:</b> Review the change register in weekly/biweekly forums. Spotlight trends, bottlenecks, and cumulative impact.</li>
</ul>

b:T57e,
<p>Credible decisions depend on credible estimates. Anchor analysis in baselines and quantify uncertainty.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Scope:</b> Decompose the change using the WBS. Map to specific work packages, interfaces, and nonfunctional requirements (performance, security, compliance).</li>
  <li><b>Schedule:</b> Perform critical-path checks. Apply three-point estimates (optimistic/most likely/pessimistic), resource-leveling assumptions, and vendor lead-times. Document sequencing changes and buffer consumption.</li>
  <li><b>Cost:</b> Estimate labor, materials, subcontractors, licenses, and overhead. Separate <i>contingency</i> (known-unknowns tied to the estimate) from <i>management reserve</i> (unknown-unknowns at the portfolio level). Define pricing (T&M vs. fixed), markups, and change order minimums.</li>
  <li><b>Risk:</b> Use probability–impact and expected monetary value. Record new risks and risk responses (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept). Adjust contingency accordingly.</li>
  <li><b>Commercial and compliance:</b> Respect notice periods, waiver risks, and contractual change clauses. Specify effects on milestones, warranties, SLAs, and acceptance tests.</li>
  <li><b>Decision-ready options:</b> Present at least two viable alternatives plus a do-nothing case, each with scope, schedule, cost deltas, and risk profile, so sponsors can choose trade-offs consciously.</li>
</ul>

c:T556,
<p>Even perfect analysis fails without buy-in. Communication turns numbers into decisions.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Roles and responsibilities:</b> Clarify who requests, who analyzes, who approves, and who executes (RACI). Avoid “decision by email drift.”</li>
  <li><b><a href="/posts/post-10" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-medium" title="7 Tips from <a href="/posts/post-10" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-medium" title="7 Tips from Clients about Change Orders">Clients</a> about Change Orders">Client</a>-facing narrative:</b> Lead with the business problem, explain options and impacts in plain language, and state the recommendation and rationale. Use executive summaries for speed.</li>
  <li><b>Negotiation and expectations:</b> Practice give–get trade-offs (scope vs. time vs. budget). Guard against scope creep by tying changes to measurable outcomes and acceptance criteria.</li>
  <li><b>Documentation discipline:</b> Maintain a living change log with unique IDs, originator, status, baseline deltas, approvals, and links to requirements and test cases. Version control all artifacts for an auditable trail.</li>
  <li><b>Visibility:</b> Publish a simple dashboard: open changes by phase, average cycle time, cumulative cost/schedule impact, and top blockers. Transparency reduces friction.</li>
</ul>
