a:T5a8,

<p>Your best leverage is before mobilization. Bake <a href="/posts/post-8" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-medium" title="Change Order Management Best Practices">change management</a> into the contract so everyone plays by known rules. Consider clauses that:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Define change</i>: Clear thresholds for what requires a formal change versus a field directive.</li>
<li><i>Notice requirements</i>: Contractor must notify within a set number of days with preliminary cost and time impact.</li>
<li><i>Pricing methodologies</i>: Hierarchy of pricing—pre-agreed unit rates first, then lump sum, then time and materials with caps.</li>
<li><i>Allowable markups</i>: Transparent labor burden components and caps on overhead and profit, including for subcontractors and tiers.</li>
<li><i>Documentation standards</i>: Timecards, material invoices, equipment rates, and schedule fragnet for any time request.</li>
<li><i>Time extensions</i>: Basis for entitlement, float ownership, and concurrency handling.</li>
<li><i>Audit rights</i>: Owner ability to verify backup and books for T&amp;M changes.</li>
<li><i>Dispute ladder</i>: Early neutral evaluation, mediation, or a dispute review board to resolve issues without litigation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Establishing these guardrails reduces debates, shortens cycle time, and produces consistent, defensible outcomes when auditors or stakeholders ask hard questions.</p>

b:T4cc,

<p>A disciplined workflow prevents rework and re-pricing chaos. A practical client-side process is:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Identification</b>: Event logged with a concise description, drawing references, and potential cost/schedule flags.</li>
<li><b>Clarification</b>: Issue an RFI or directive to define scope boundaries; gather affected trades early.</li>
<li><b>Pricing request</b>: Contractor submits a priced proposal with quantities, labor/equipment hours, material quotes, and schedule fragnet.</li>
<li><b>Independent check</b>: Owner’s QS/CM prepares an independent estimate and schedule impact review.</li>
<li><b>Negotiation</b>: Resolve scope inclusions/exclusions, quantities, and rates; consider options and alternates.</li>
<li><b>Authorization</b>: Approve a formal change order or issue a not-to-exceed authorization with conditions and time impact terms.</li>
<li><b>Implementation</b>: Incorporate into drawings, model, buyout, and short-interval plans; communicate to field crews.</li>
<li><b>Closeout</b>: Verify delivery, collect final backup, update the change log, budget, SOV, and schedule baseline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every step should be time-bound; long lags are where cost overruns and claims grow.</p>

c:T40f,

<p>Owners benefit from a transparent, first-principles approach to pricing. Start with quantities and production rates, then check labor, material, equipment, and subcontractor costs. For labor, distinguish base wage, fringes, payroll taxes, and actual burden. For equipment, use contract rate schedules or published rental indices. For materials, request current <a href="/posts/post-9" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-medium" title="7 Tips from <a href="/posts/post-9" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-medium" title="7 Tips from Suppliers about Change Orders">Suppliers</a> about Change Orders">supplier</a> quotes.</p>

<p>Choose the right pricing method for the situation: lump sum when scope is well defined; pre-agreed unit rates when quantities vary; time-and-materials for emergencies or investigative work, but with not-to-exceed caps and daily signed tickets. Insist on consistent markup rules across all tiers and monitor cumulative markups when multiple subs are involved.</p>
