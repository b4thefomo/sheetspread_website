**(Intro Music fades in and then fades to a low background hum)**

**Sarah:** Welcome to "Site Unseen," the podcast that cuts through the noise of the construction industry. I'm Sarah Clarke, a construction researcher.

**Mike:** And I'm Mike Davies, an Ops Manager for a tier 1 contractor.

**Sarah:** Right, let's get straight to it. Today's topic: change orders. Mike, I know for a fact they're the bane of your existence.

**Mike:** You're not wrong, Sarah. They’re a nightmare. A client changes their mind, the paperwork piles up, the schedule gets blown out, and nine times out of ten, we end up arguing over scraps and losing margin. They’re a profit-killer.

**Sarah:** That’s the traditional view. But what if I told you every single change order could, and *should*, make you money?

**Mike:** I’d say you’ve been spending too much time with academics and not enough on a live site.

**Sarah:** (Chuckles) Fair point. But this isn't theory; it's a fundamental mindset shift. Today, we're going to talk about exactly how to do that. We’ll cover the shift from a reactive to an investment mindset, how to price for value instead of just cost, and why your documentation is your best commercial tool. Let's make this practical.

**(Slight pause, music fades out completely)**

**Sarah:** So, Mike, describe the typical change order process for your team right now.

**Mike:** It’s chaos, honestly. A request for information or a client email comes in mid-project. The project manager groans, the quantity surveyor has to scramble to price it up based on labour and materials, and then we present it. The client sees a cost for something they think is minor, pushes back, and suddenly we're in a three-week-long negotiation that holds up the works. Everyone gets frustrated.

**Sarah:** That’s the reactive mindset in a nutshell. You see it as a deviation, a problem to be minimised. The investment mindset flips that completely. You have to see that change request not as a disruption, but as the client wanting to invest *more* money into their asset. And your job is to facilitate that investment profitably.

**Mike:** Okay, I get the concept. But how do we actually *do* that in practice? When the pressure is on and the client’s architect is breathing down our necks?

**Sarah:** It starts before you even break ground. Your process has to be defined in the contract, crystal clear. What constitutes a change, who approves it, and the pricing structure. No ambiguity. When a change request comes in, you don't just send a price. You call a meeting. You treat it as a collaborative consultation.

**Mike:** A consultation? We don’t have time for that on every minor tweak.

**Sarah:** This is the crucial part. It’s not about the tweak; it’s about the opportunity. This leads to the second point: pricing for value, not just cost. Your QS is pricing the cost of a few hours and some plasterboard. That's a mistake. You need to price the *solution* and the *value* it adds.

**Mike:** Give me an example.

**Sarah:** Right. Let's say you're building an office block. The client asks to add a dedicated server room with enhanced cooling late in the game. The reactive approach is to price the extra ducts, the AC unit, and the labour. Maybe £10,000. You'll argue over it for a week.

**Mike:** Sounds about right.

**Sarah:** The investment approach is different. You sit down with them and say, "Brilliant idea. A proper server room increases the lettable value of this floor and makes it far more attractive to a high-spec tech tenant. We can deliver a turnkey solution for you. We’ll handle the design, the install, the security integration. This change doesn’t cost £10k; it *adds* £50k in annual rent potential to your building. Our price to deliver that value is £25,000." You've just framed it as a return on investment, not a cost.

**Mike:** That’s a massive shift in how we talk about it. It turns our PMs into consultants. I can see that working for big changes, but what about the small, fiddly ones? "Move this wall six inches to the left."

**Sarah:** Perfect. That's your trigger to upsell. Don't just see the wall. See the room. The client wants to move a wall? Your first question should be, "Okay, let's talk about why. What are you trying to achieve with this space? While we have the walls open, have you considered adding integrated data points, upgrading the lighting, or adding acoustic insulation? We can do it far more efficiently now than later." You're proactively solving problems they haven't even thought of yet.

**Mike:** And that all comes with a price tag. But it also means a hell of a lot more paperwork to avoid disputes down the line.

**Sarah:** Absolutely. And that’s the final, non-negotiable point: document everything meticulously. Every conversation, every option discussed, every decision made. Use your project management software. A change order isn't approved until it's signed, with a clear scope of works and an agreed price. This isn't just about covering your back; it's about professionalism. It shows the client you’re organised and that their investment is being managed properly. It builds trust, which makes them *more* likely to approve future changes.

**Mike:** So, if I'm hearing you right, the plan is to stop groaning and start seeing pound signs. It’s about proactive communication upfront, pricing the solution's value, and locking it all down with watertight documentation.

**Sarah:** Exactly. You're not just a builder taking instructions; you're a commercial partner helping them maximise the value of their asset. When you start acting like one, they start treating you—and paying you—like one. Stop managing change orders and start selling them.

**Mike:** Right. Food for thought. I’ve got a few PMs who need to hear this. Cheers, Sarah.

**Sarah:** Any time, Mike.
