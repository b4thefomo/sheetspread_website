**Sarah:** You’re on-site, a client requests a change, and you spend days pricing up the perfect solution. You present it, and all you get back is a blank stare, a non-committal "we'll think about it," and a project that's now officially stalled. Sound familiar?

**Mike:** Sarah, you’ve just described my Tuesday. We’re burning programme time waiting for a decision because the client can’t seem to pull the trigger. It’s infuriating.

---

**Sarah:** It’s a classic bottleneck, Mike. And it’s usually because we’re not giving them a real decision to make. Welcome to *Constructive Dialogue*, the show that cuts the fluff and gets straight to the point. I'm Sarah King.

**Mike:** And I’m Mike Davies. Today, we're talking about a simple but powerful shift: stop presenting single solutions and start presenting decision-ready options. We’ll be covering how to frame genuine trade-offs, how to quantify the impact of each choice, and how to force a clear, quick decision from your client.

---

**Sarah:** Right, let's get into it. The core problem, Mike, is that we often think we know what the client wants. We hear "we need to accelerate the schedule" and we jump to pricing up a 24/7 working pattern.

**Mike:** Exactly. We present the eye-watering cost for that, and they get sticker shock. Then everything grinds to a halt. We’ve given them a yes/no answer, and 'no' is always the easier option for a client worried about their budget.

**Sarah:** Precisely. You’ve presented a problem, not a choice. The first step, before you even open a spreadsheet, is to understand their *actual* driver. Is the hard deadline for the store opening more important than the final budget? Is the long-term quality of the asset non-negotiable, even if it adds two weeks to the programme?

**Mike:** We had that on a data centre job. The client was fighting us on every penny of a variation for faster-curing concrete. The conversation changed completely when we framed it not as a cost, but as a choice. We asked, "What is the commercial cost to you for every day this data centre is not operational?" Suddenly, schedule was king and the variation was approved in an hour.

**Sarah:** Spot on. You uncovered the real KPI. Once you have that, you can craft the options. This is where the magic is. Never present one option. Always present three.

**Mike:** So, like a good, better, best scenario?

**Sarah:** Exactly. But for construction, it's more like the "Cost, Time, Quality" triangle. Let's use a real-world example. Say the client wants to change the external cladding specification mid-project.

**Mike:** A classic. And a nightmare for procurement.

**Sarah:** Instead of just pricing the new spec, you go back with a one-page summary. It looks like this:

*   **Option A: The Baseline.** We stick with the originally specified cladding. Cost impact: zero. Schedule impact: zero. But, you don't get the new look you asked for.
*   **Option B: The Balanced Choice.** We use the new spec from a supplier we can get on a six-week lead time. Cost impact: plus £80,000. Schedule impact: a two-week delay to the envelope.
*   **Option C: The Premium Accelerator.** We can get a near-identical premium alternative that’s in stock in the UK. We can air-freight the fixings. Cost impact: plus £150,000. Schedule impact: zero. We hold the completion date.

**Mike:** I see it straight away. You’ve made it their decision. Do they value £70,000 more than a two-week delay? You’ve taken the responsibility off your shoulders and put the choice, and the consequence, squarely in their court. It's not you telling them it's expensive; it's you showing them the price of speed.

**Sarah:** And the key is to quantify everything. Don't just say "schedule impact." Say "14-day delay to practical completion, which may incur liquidated damages of £10,000 per day." Frame your cost against their risk. That £150k for Option C suddenly looks like a bargain if it saves them £140k in damages and gets their tenants in on time.

**Mike:** That changes the entire dynamic of the conversation. You’re no longer a contractor asking for more money; you’re a partner presenting commercial options. What about the presentation itself? We can get bogged down in detailed programmes and quote sheets.

**Sarah:** Keep it brutally simple. A single A4 page. A table with the three options as rows, and the columns being: 'Description', 'Cost Impact', 'Schedule Impact', and 'Key Benefit/Risk'. No jargon. Just the hard numbers. The detailed breakdown can be in an appendix if they want it, but the decision should be makeable from that one page.

**Mike:** And what’s the final piece? How do you ensure they actually *make* the decision?

**Sarah:** A clear, firm call to action at the bottom of the page. Something like: "To secure material lead times for Option B or C, a decision is required by 17:00 on Friday. If no decision is received, we will proceed with Option A." You create urgency and a default path, which protects you and forces them to engage.

---

**Sarah:** So, to wrap this up. To get clients to make decisions, you have to give them a real choice. Stop serving up a single, take-it-or-leave-it solution.

**Mike:** Right. My key takeaway is this: for the next change request, my team is preparing a simple, one-page option summary. Three choices, clear cost and time impacts for each, and a hard deadline for the decision. Make them the master of their own destiny.

**Sarah:** That’s the way. You’re not just a builder; you’re a trusted advisor. That’s how you get things moving.

**(Podcast outro music fades in)**

**Mike:** Cheers, Sarah. That’s a process we can put in place this afternoon.

**Sarah:** Good. Let us know how it goes. You've been listening to *Constructive Dialogue*. Join us next time.
