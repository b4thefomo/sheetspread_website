**Sarah:** Right, let’s get straight to it. Mike, another week, another battle with change orders, I assume?

**Mike:** You know it, Sarah. Had one land on my desk yesterday. Client changed their mind on a cladding specification. Now the commercial team is scrambling, the planner is pulling his hair out, and my site manager is looking at a two-week delay before we’ve even priced the thing. It’s draining our contingency and our goodwill.

**Sarah:** A classic scenario. It’s the single biggest point of friction on most major projects. That’s exactly what we’re tackling today. Welcome to "Site-Level Strategy." I'm Sarah King.

**Mike:** And I’m Mike Davies. As an ops manager for a tier 1 contractor, I live this every day.

**Sarah:** Today, we’re cutting the fluff. We’re going to cover three things you can do to get a grip on change orders. First, establishing a non-negotiable, lean process. Second, how to estimate the impact without spending weeks on it. And third, nailing stakeholder communication so you’re not fighting every decision. No theory, just what works on site.

**Mike:** Good. So, the process. Right now, it feels like chaos. Requests come in through email, a comment on a drawing, a phone call. There’s no single point of entry. How do we fix that?

**Sarah:** You kill the chaos with a simple, mandatory intake form. Not a ten-page bureaucratic nightmare, but a one-pager. It must capture the 'why'—the business problem—not just the 'what'. What’s the rationale, who requested it, and what’s the perceived urgency? Make it a rule: no form, no change request. It doesn't enter the system.

**Mike:** I like that. It forces the client or our own team to think before they fire off an email. What’s next? Triage?

**Sarah:** Exactly. Triage. You classify it immediately. Is it a defect, an enhancement, or a genuine scope gap? Then you apply a threshold. Anything under, say, five grand and with no schedule impact gets fast-tracked. The project manager can approve it on the spot. Anything over that goes for a full impact analysis. You stop wasting time debating the colour of a door handle with the same rigour as a structural change.

**Mike:** That makes sense. Fast-track the small stuff. But the full analysis is where we get bogged down. The commercial director wants a full cost breakdown, the planner needs to re-sequence the whole programme… all for a change the client might reject anyway.

**Sarah:** This is where you stop delivering one perfect, time-consuming estimate. You provide options. Think gold, silver, and bronze. ‘Gold’ is exactly what they asked for, with the full cost and time impact. ‘Silver’ is a slightly different approach that delivers 80% of the value for 50% of the cost. ‘Bronze’ might be a minimal version or a phased approach.

**Mike:** So we’re not just pricing their idea, we’re solving their underlying problem in different ways.

**Sarah:** Precisely. And for each option, you give a clear delta: this is the impact on scope, schedule, and cost against the baseline. You anchor everything to your Work Breakdown Structure and your critical path. You must be explicit about risk. "If we choose this option, we introduce a new risk to the M&E interface, and we'll need to allocate £10k of contingency to cover it." It makes the trade-offs tangible for the client.

**Mike:** Okay, so we have a solid process and credible options. But we still have to get it approved. I’ve seen decisions get stuck in email chains for weeks. We call it 'decision by email drift'.

**Sarah:** You kill that with two things. First, an authority matrix. It’s a simple chart: who approves what. The PM approves up to £5k. The Project Director up to £50k. The steering committee for anything above that. It's black and white. No ambiguity.

**Mike:** So everyone knows who the decision-maker is.

**Sarah:** Yes. And second, you control the narrative. Stop sending a spreadsheet full of numbers. You lead with a one-paragraph executive summary. "Problem: The client requires a change to the cladding. Recommendation: We recommend Option B, which meets the new aesthetic requirement for an additional £45,000 and a 7-day schedule extension. Rationale: This option provides the best value and mitigates lead-time risk associated with Option A." It’s direct, it’s in plain English, and it respects their time.

**Mike:** And you make all this visible.

**Sarah:** Absolutely. A simple dashboard. How many open changes, what’s their cumulative cost, and where are the bottlenecks? When the client can see that their requests are causing a three-week approval delay, the conversation changes. Transparency builds trust and forces accountability.

**Mike:** Right, that’s it. Three clear actions. A mandatory intake form and triage system to manage the flow. Presenting 'gold, silver, bronze' options to speed up estimating. And an authority matrix to kill decision drift.

**Sarah:** Spot on. It’s about shifting the mindset. A change order isn’t an administrative headache; it’s a mini business case. If you treat it with that discipline, you protect your margin, your timeline, and your relationships. It becomes a controlled investment, not a surprise cost.

**Mike:** Excellent. I’m starting with the intake form and authority matrix on my project tomorrow. Thanks, Sarah.

**Sarah:** Anytime, Mike.
