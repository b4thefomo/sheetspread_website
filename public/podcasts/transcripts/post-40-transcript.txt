**Podcast Title:** Site-Level Strategy
**Episode Title:** Change Orders: Why We're Stuck in the Slow Lane

**(Intro music fades in and then fades to a low background hum)**

**Sarah:** Welcome to Site-Level Strategy. I’m Sarah, and I spend my days researching why our industry works the way it does. With me is Mike.

**Mike:** Mike, Operations Manager for a Tier 1 contractor. I’m the one on site dealing with the fallout of those processes.

**Sarah:** Right. Today, we're tackling the one thing that grinds projects to a halt and kills margins: the change order process. We're going to talk about why our system is fundamentally broken, the real financial cost of these delays, and what we can actually do about it. No theory, just facts.

**Mike:** Good. Because I’ve just lost two weeks and burned through contingency arguing about moving a partition wall six inches. It’s madness.

**Sarah:** That’s the perfect starting point, Mike. Let’s compare that to the tech sector for a second. If a software company finds a bug or wants to change a button colour, they fix it, push an update, and it’s live in hours, maybe a day.

**Mike:** Right, they just get it done. For us, that six-inch wall move triggers a formal change order. The request goes in, the QS has to price it, the architect has to approve it, the client has to sign off. Each step is a potential argument, a delay. We’re talking weeks, sometimes months, before we can even pick up a tool.

**Sarah:** Exactly. And my research shows the average change order in construction takes 3 to 4 weeks for approval on a good day. For that software company, a four-week delay to fix a critical bug would bankrupt them. They’d lose all their customers. We treat that as business as usual.

**Mike:** It’s because it’s baked into the contract, isn't it? The whole system is designed for conflict, not speed. Every change is a mini-renegotiation. It becomes about allocating blame and cost, not solving the problem and moving the project forward. We're not incentivised to be agile.

**Sarah:** You’ve hit the nail on the head. The contracts are a minefield. They’re built to assign risk, which means every time something deviates from the plan, a formal, legally-binding process kicks in. A tech company's agreement is about delivering a functional product; ours is about delivering a pre-defined scope, and any deviation is treated with suspicion.

**Mike:** And the financial bleed is what kills me. It’s not just the direct cost of the change. It's the project manager’s time spent chasing paper. It’s the trades I’ve got on standby, unable to work on that section. The knock-on effect on the programme is immense, and those delay costs are always disputed. We’re burning cash waiting for a signature.

**Sarah:** Let’s talk about communication. In tech, they use Slack, daily stand-ups, instant feedback. It’s fast, informal, and constant. How does a change get communicated on your site?

**Mike:** Formally. Always. It’s an RFI, a drawing revision notice, an official instruction. It's a paper trail designed to protect everyone’s back, but it’s incredibly inefficient. You lose all nuance. Instead of a five-minute conversation between the architect and the foreman to solve a problem, you get a three-week formal exchange that creates more confusion than it resolves. There’s zero transparency.

**Sarah:** And that opacity breeds mistrust. The client thinks we’re trying to fleece them on the price, we think they’re trying to get extra work for free. The whole process is adversarial by design. It’s a culture clash between what needs to happen on-site and what the back office requires.

**Mike:** So we know it's broken. It's slow, it’s expensive, and it causes fights. The question is, what’s the practical fix? I can’t change the JCT contract on my own. What can I actually do on Monday morning to make this less painful?

**Sarah:** Right, let’s get practical. Two things. First, you have to triage your changes. Not every issue needs the full, formal process. Agree on a threshold with the client and QS—say, anything under a grand or with no programme impact gets agreed with a simple site instruction and priced later in a batch. Stop the bureaucracy for minor issues.

**Mike:** I like that. A "fast lane" for small changes. It’d cut down the noise. What’s the second thing?

**Sarah:** Get everyone in a room. Or on a call. The moment a significant change is requested, get the decision-makers—client, architect, QS, and you—together for 30 minutes. Hash out the impact, agree on a path forward, and document that one decision. Replace the weeks of email tennis with a single, focused conversation. Force the collaboration that the process is designed to prevent.

**Mike:** Simple. Proactive communication. It’s not a silver bullet, but it stops the rot before it sets in. Good, that’s something I can use.

**Sarah:** That's the plan. Join us next time on Site-Level Strategy.
