**Sarah:** Another project programme slipping. Another client meeting where you’re having to explain delays that, frankly, you saw coming. It’s a constant battle on site.

**Mike:** Tell me about it, Sarah. We spend weeks building these detailed programmes, and they’re out of date the second we break ground. They feel more like a work of fiction than a management tool.

---

**Sarah:** And that’s the problem we’re cutting through today. We’re not talking about abstract theory; we're talking about two powerful, practical techniques that will make your schedules more resilient and realistic. We'll cover the Critical Path Method – what it is and why it matters – and how to supercharge it with Three-Point Estimation.

**Mike:** Good. I need something I can actually give to my project managers tomorrow. Less paperwork, more predictability. Let’s get into it.

---

**Sarah:** Right, let’s start with the basics: The Critical Path Method, or CPM. In simple terms, it’s about finding the longest chain of dependent tasks in your project. That chain dictates the absolute minimum time your project will take.

**Mike:** So, it’s the one sequence of jobs where if any single one of them is delayed, the final handover date gets pushed out, day for day.

**Sarah:** Exactly. Think of a simple build. Pouring the foundations, erecting the frame, getting the roof on to make it watertight. Those tasks have to happen in that order. That’s your critical path. Delay the concrete pour by a week because of bad weather, and your entire project is delayed by a week. It’s that direct.

**Mike:** I get the concept. But my programmes have thousands of tasks. Finding that one path sounds like a nightmare. How do you do it without getting bogged down?

**Sarah:** You don’t need to overcomplicate it. Four steps. First, list every major task. Second, sequence them – what has to happen before what? Third, estimate how long each one will take. And finally, you map it out. The software does the heavy lifting, but the logic is what matters. It forces you to visualise the dependencies, not just look at a list of dates. That map immediately shows you the longest path through the project.

**Mike:** Okay, that makes sense. But step three – estimating duration – is where it always falls apart for us. The lads on site are either wildly optimistic, or they build in so much fat that the programme is uncompetitive from the start. There's no realism.

**Sarah:** And that is the perfect entry point for the second technique: Three-Point Estimation. It’s designed specifically to combat that exact problem. Instead of asking for one number, you ask for three.

**Mike:** Go on.

**Sarah:** For any given task—say, installing the curtain walling on one elevation—you ask the team for three estimates. First, the **Optimistic (O)**: what’s the absolute best-case scenario if everything goes perfectly—no delays, perfect weather, materials on time?

**Mike:** Which never happens.

**Sarah:** Correct. Then, the **Pessimistic (P)**: the worst-case scenario. The delivery lorry gets stuck, the fixings are wrong, key people are off sick. What’s the longest it could reasonably take?

**Mike:** Okay, that’s easy enough to imagine. And the third?

**Sarah:** The **Most Likely (M)**. Based on their experience, what do they *actually* think it will take? This is their gut feeling, the realistic number.

**Mike:** Right, so I have three numbers. An optimistic one I don't believe, a pessimistic one that scares the client, and a realistic one. What do I do with them?

**Sarah:** You use a simple weighted average to find a more accurate duration. The formula is: Optimistic, plus four times the Most Likely, plus the Pessimistic, all divided by six.

**Mike:** (Slight pause) Why four times the middle one?

**Sarah:** Because it grounds the estimate in reality. It gives more weight to the most likely outcome while still acknowledging the risks and opportunities at either end. It pulls that final number away from pure optimism and gives you a risk-adjusted duration.

**Mike:** I see. So you’re not just guessing anymore; you’re calculating a more probable outcome. So, the key is to use these three-point estimates for the tasks in my critical path?

**Sarah:** Now you’ve got it. That’s how you integrate them. You identify your critical path using CPM, and then you fortify that path by using three-point estimates for every single task along it. It makes your most important timeline robust. Suddenly, your programme isn't just a list of dates; it's a risk model. You know exactly where to focus your attention.

**Mike:** And that becomes my risk register, essentially. If a task is on the critical path, my team needs to be all over it—managing the supply chain, lining up the labour, having a contingency plan.

**Sarah:** Precisely. Your critical path is your project’s nervous system. Protect it, and you protect the project.

---

**Mike:** Right, that's genuinely useful. So, the key takeaways are: First, map the critical path to understand the project's non-negotiable sequence. Don't get lost in the weeds; focus on the main dependencies.

**Sarah:** And second, for those critical tasks, ditch the single-point guess. Use the Optimistic, Pessimistic, and Most Likely estimates to build a duration that has realism baked in. It’ll give you a forecast you can actually stand behind.

**Mike:** Simple. Actionable. I can take that to my team this afternoon. Cheers, Sarah.
