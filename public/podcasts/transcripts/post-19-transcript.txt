**Sarah:** Welcome to Site-Level Strategy, the podcast that cuts through the noise. I’m Sarah, a construction research analyst.

**Mike:** And I’m Mike, an Operations Manager for a Tier 1 contractor.

**Sarah:** Today, we’re tackling a problem that cripples projects before they’ve even had a chance: the absolute chaos of change requests. We're getting straight into how to standardize your intake process.

**Mike:** Thank God. I’m drowning in it. Emails, WhatsApps, verbal instructions on site, scribbled notes… it’s a mess. Half the time we don’t even know what’s an official instruction and what’s just noise.

**Sarah:** Exactly. In the next four minutes, we are going to fix that. We'll cover three critical steps: first, defining what actually constitutes a change; second, building a bulletproof intake form; and third, creating a single point of entry so nothing gets lost. Let's get into it.

---

**Sarah:** Right, Mike. The starting point for most firms is a complete disaster. There’s no standard. Why is this so dangerous on a major project?

**Mike:** It’s lethal. A vague email from a client's rep lands in a project manager's inbox. He forwards it to the commercial team, but forgets to copy in design. The site team hears a rumour and starts pricing for something that isn’t even confirmed. Weeks are lost, money is spent on assumptions, and everyone is pointing fingers. It grinds progress to a halt.

**Sarah:** That’s the classic symptom. The cure starts with a simple, brutal question: What is a ‘change’ for your business? You have to define it. Is it a formal client variation? An instruction from the architect? An unforeseen site condition logged by a subcontractor?

**Mike:** So, we need a formal definition that everyone understands. Client instruction, design team clarification with cost implications, or a site-identified issue. Everything else is just a query until it's properly raised.

**Sarah:** Precisely. It’s a gate. If it doesn’t meet the definition, it doesn’t get in. That’s step one. This brings us to the tool for that gate: the change request form. People hear ‘form’ and they groan.

**Mike:** They do. They see it as more paperwork. Another blocker to just getting the job done. How do you get buy-in from the site teams who just want to crack on?

**Sarah:** You sell it as a weapon, not a chore. It’s their protection. A good form isn’t long, it’s just precise. It needs to capture the non-negotiables. One: Who’s asking and when? Two: What is it, in plain English, with drawings or specs attached? Three: *Why* is it needed? What’s the driver – a client request, a safety issue, a design error?

**Mike:** I’d add a fourth: What’s the immediate perceived impact? The person raising it needs to have a first go at stating the potential effect on programme, cost, and other trades. Forces them to think it through.

**Sarah:** That’s the crucial bit. The impact assessment. And finally, a requested priority level. Is this a ‘down tools, we can’t proceed without it’ change, or a ‘nice to have’? This simple form kills ambiguity stone dead. It ensures the commercial and operational teams get the *same* baseline information, every single time.

**Mike:** Okay, that makes sense. A clear definition and a standard form. But where do the forms go? If they’re just emailed to a project-specific inbox, we’re still in the same mess, just with tidier attachments. It’s still a black hole.

**Sarah:** And that’s the final piece of the puzzle – the single front door. Email is not a system. You need a centralized intake platform. This could be a dedicated change management module in your CDE, or even a simple SharePoint list. The tool doesn't matter as much as the principle: one place for all change requests to be logged.

**Mike:** A single source of truth.

**Sarah:** Exactly. When a request is submitted, it gets a unique ID number. It’s logged. It’s visible. It can be tracked from submission to approval to instruction. No more, "Did you see my email?" or "I told him on site last Tuesday." If it's not in the system with an ID, it doesn't exist. End of story. This gives you transparency and creates a proper audit trail.

**Mike:** Right, so anyone from the QS to the Project Director can see the status of any change at any time. It takes the guesswork and the arguments out of it. It’s about control.

---

**Sarah:** That's it. It’s about taking back control. So, let’s wrap this up with the takeaways. Mike, what are the three things an Ops Manager can do next Monday morning?

**Mike:** First, get the senior team in a room and agree on a black-and-white definition of a ‘change.’ Second, draft a simple, mandatory intake form with the key fields we discussed. Third, ditch the email inbox and designate a single, central platform for logging them.

**Sarah:** Define it. Standardize it. Centralize it. It’s not rocket science, it’s just process discipline. Get that right, and you stop fighting fires and start managing the project.

**Mike:** Sorted. Now, about the approval process…

**Sarah:** That’s a conversation for next time.
