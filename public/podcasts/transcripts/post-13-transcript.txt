**Sarah:** Another week, another project getting hammered by change orders. It’s the one constant that can bleed a job dry, but most firms still treat it as a reactive fire-fight.

**Mike:** Tell me about it, Sarah. We’re on the City Tower project and it feels like death by a thousand cuts. A small design tweak here, an unforeseen ground condition there… suddenly we’re looking at a serious impact on the programme and the commercials. We need a better way to handle it.

**Sarah:** Right. And that’s what we’re cutting through today. No theory, just practical advice. We're going to cover why change orders are inevitable, why most management of them fails, and most importantly, the practical steps you can take on-site and in the office tomorrow to get them under control.

**Mike:** Good. Because "inevitable" can't mean "unmanageable." Where do we start?

**Sarah:** We have to start by accepting the reality: you will never eliminate them. No one has a crystal ball. You start a project with incomplete information. The client evolves their requirements, a new bit of tech becomes available, or your own team makes a mistake. That’s the job.

**Mike:** It’s the evolving client requirements that kill us. We lock in a scope, then six months in, the architect has a 'brilliant new idea' or the client’s been on Pinterest. We end up with scope creep that isn't properly documented, and the QS is pulling his hair out trying to price it retrospectively.

**Sarah:** Exactly. And that’s the real issue. The problem isn’t the change itself, it’s the lack of a bulletproof process for managing it. When you don't have one, you get the chaos you’re describing. Budget overruns, schedule delays, and a client relationship that sours because they don’t understand why their 'small change' is costing a fortune and a three-week delay.

**Mike:** So, a formal process. We have one, on paper. But getting the site team to follow it, to document every single conversation… that’s the challenge. It’s seen as more paperwork when they’re already under pressure.

**Sarah:** Then the process is wrong. It has to be simple, clear, and non-negotiable. It should be as routine as a daily safety briefing. Here are the three pillars: First, a single point of submission. No verbal agreements on site, no emails to random engineers. Every potential change goes through one channel.

**Mike:** A single, documented request. I like it. What’s second?

**Sarah:** Second, rapid impact assessment. As soon as that request comes in, the PM, QS, and relevant site manager immediately assess its impact on cost, schedule, and resources. Not next week, now. This is where technology is a game-changer. Using good project management software means you can model the impact in minutes, not days. You get a real-time view instead of working off an outdated spreadsheet.

**Mike:** So we can go back to the client straight away and say, "Yes, we can do that, and here is the exact cost and time implication. Sign here." It takes the emotion out of it.

**Sarah:** Precisely. It turns a potential dispute into a commercial transaction. And the third pillar is meticulous documentation. Every approval, every revision, every scrap of communication is attached to that change order in a centralised system. It becomes your single source of truth if there are any arguments down the line. It protects you, the client, and the project.

**Mike:** Okay, that’s managing the change when it hits. But how do we reduce the number of them in the first place? Prevention has to be better than the cure.

**Sarah:** Absolutely. This comes down to the pre-construction phase. You need to be almost painfully thorough in requirements gathering. Get every stakeholder in a room and don’t leave until the scope of work is defined to a granular level. The more ambiguity you remove upfront, the less room there is for "interpretations" later.

**Mike:** So, more time spent in planning means less pain in execution.

**Sarah:** Always. That, and building a realistic contingency into your budget and schedule from day one. Not as a slush fund, but as a properly managed buffer for the minor, genuine unknowns. If you plan for small changes, they don't derail the entire project when they inevitably appear. Proactive risk management isn’t a nice-to-have; it's essential.

---

**Mike:** Right, that’s clear. So, if I’m walking back into the office now, what are my immediate actions?

**Sarah:** First, review your current change management process. Is it truly simple, fast, and non-negotiable? If not, fix it. Second, audit your technology. If you’re still managing this on email and Excel, you’re losing. Get a system that gives you a single source of truth.

**Mike:** Bulletproof the process and get the right tools for the job. Simple. It’s about shifting from being a victim of change to being in control of it.

**Sarah:** That's it exactly. You’ll never stop the rain, but you can buy a better coat. Get the process right, and change orders become a managed part of the job, not a project-killing crisis.
