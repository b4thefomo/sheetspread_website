**Sarah:** Welcome to Site Talk. I’m Sarah King.

**Mike:** And I’m Mike Davies. Sarah, another project just wrapped, and again, the final cost is a good 15% over the tender price. The culprit, as always, is a mountain of change orders. It feels like we're constantly fighting fires instead of building.

**Sarah:** It’s a classic story, Mike. Profitability gets eaten alive by a thousand little changes. That’s exactly what we’re tackling today. No fluff, just the most common drivers of change orders and the practical steps to get ahead of them. We’ll hit the big three: flawed pre-construction, unforeseen site conditions, and the chaos of client changes.

---

**Mike:** Right, let’s get straight into it. For me, it feels like most problems start before we even break ground. The information we get handed is… optimistic at best.

**Sarah:** It almost always comes back to the scope. Incomplete or ambiguous scope is the number one driver. A line on a drawing that just says ‘Install electrical system’ isn’t a scope, it’s a guess. You end up with endless RFIs, assumptions, and then the inevitable change order when the client says, "Oh, I thought that included data cabling for 200 workstations."

**Mike:** Tell me about it. We had exactly that on a recent office fit-out. The drawings were vague, the client assumed, we assumed. It cost us two weeks and a small fortune in rework and materials. So what’s the fix? How do you pin a client down who doesn’t know what they want?

**Sarah:** You force the conversation, early and often. Before any contract is signed, you run a detailed scope workshop. Get all the key players in one room—the architect, the engineer, the client, and your senior site team. Use diagrams, mockups, whatever it takes. The goal is to walk out with a document so detailed that there’s zero room for interpretation. Make them sign off on it. It feels slow at the start, but it saves you months of pain on the back end.

**Mike:** So, front-load the difficult conversations. I like it. But what about when the design itself is the problem? Errors and omissions in the drawings seem to be getting worse. The designers are so disconnected from the reality of construction.

**Sarah:** That’s the second major driver. A spec that calls for a material that won't be available for six months, or a structural detail that’s physically impossible to build. You don’t find these things until you’re on-site, tools in hand, and the clock is ticking.

**Mike:** And every time that happens, we have to stop, raise the issue, wait for a redesign, and submit a change order for the delay and extra cost. It grinds everything to a halt.

**Sarah:** Exactly. The best practice here is a ruthless, multi-disciplinary design review process. Your operations people—the ones who will actually build it—need to be red-lining those drawings. They’ll spot the clashes and the impractical details that the design team, working in a silo, will miss. It's about shifting from finding problems during construction to finding them during planning.

**Mike:** Okay, so that handles the man-made problems. What about the ones you literally dig up from the ground? Unforeseen site conditions. We just finished a job where we hit a massive amount of rock that the initial survey completely missed. The budget for excavation was blown in the first week.

**Sarah:** The ‘unforeseen’ excuse is overused, Mike. More often than not, it’s ‘un-investigated’. A single desk-based survey isn’t enough. For any significant project, a thorough geotechnical investigation is a non-negotiable cost. Digging extra trial pits is a lot cheaper than bringing in specialist rock-breaking equipment and dealing with a two-month delay.

**Mike:** So it's about spending a bit more upfront on proper surveys to avoid a massive hit later. Makes sense. But even with all that, you still get the client changing their mind halfway through.

**Sarah:** Of course. And that’s fine, as long as it’s controlled. This is where a rigid, formal change request process is your best friend. The client wants to upgrade the flooring? No problem. But it’s not a quick chat on site. They must submit a formal request. Your commercial team then evaluates the full impact—cost, schedule, and knock-on effects for other trades—and presents it back on a formal change order form.

**Mike:** So they see the full consequence of their request in black and white before they approve it. No more "I didn't realise it would cost that much!" after the fact.

**Sarah:** Precisely. It forces discipline on everyone. It turns a casual 'nice-to-have' idea into a proper commercial decision. And underlying all of this, Mike, is communication. If the architect, engineer, and your team aren’t in constant, open dialogue, all these other processes will fail. Regular, structured meetings aren’t bureaucracy; they’re your primary risk management tool.

---

**Mike:** Right, this has been brilliant, Sarah. It’s clear we’re being too reactive. We’re managing change orders when they happen, not preventing them from happening in the first place.

**Sarah:** That’s the key takeaway. You have to shift your focus from the back end to the front end. So, to boil it down: One, conduct forensic-level scope and design reviews before you even think about starting on site. Two, invest properly in site investigations to eliminate the ‘unforeseen’. And three, implement an iron-clad change request process to control client-led changes.

**Mike:** Simple, but not easy. My first action is to get our senior site managers involved in the design reviews from day one. That’s a change we can make tomorrow. Thanks, Sarah.

**Sarah:** Anytime, Mike.
