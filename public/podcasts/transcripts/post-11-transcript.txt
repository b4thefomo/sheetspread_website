**(Podcast intro music with an industrial, driving beat, fades out)**

**Sarah:** Welcome to Site-Level Strategy, the podcast that cuts through the noise. I'm Sarah, a construction research analyst.

**Mike:** And I'm Mike, an ops manager for a tier 1. Today we're tackling a subject that’s costing us all a fortune: change orders.

---

### **Hook (30 seconds)**

**Mike:** Right, Sarah. Let's get straight to it. Change orders are out of control. It feels like every minor design shift is an excuse for a subcontractor to open up the chequebook. It’s death by a thousand cuts for my project margins.

**Sarah:** It’s more than that, Mike. For the business, a change order isn't just a site instruction. It's a budget grenade, a contract negotiation, and a major risk event all rolled into one. The goal isn't to stop changes—they're inevitable. The goal is to stop them from derailing your entire project.

### **Intro (30 seconds)**

**Mike:** Okay, so how do we do that? We need practical steps, not theory.

**Sarah:** Exactly. We’re going to cover three critical things today. First, how to build contracts that are ready for change before it even happens. Second, how to scrutinise costs and manage suppliers without burning bridges. And third, why you’re flying blind if you’re not using the right data and digital tools. No fluff, just what works.

### **Main Discussion (3.5 minutes)**

**Mike:** Alright, let’s start with contracts. It’s a nice idea to have everything buttoned up from day one, but reality on site is messy. How do you actually make a contract ‘change-ready’?

**Sarah:** You win this battle before the project even starts. You stop relying on vague clauses. Your contract must have a non-negotiable, documented process. That means standardised change request forms—no more instructions over email. It means pre-negotiated unit rates for common changes: labour grades, material markups, equipment hire.

**Mike:** Pre-negotiated rates sound great, but getting our supply chain to agree to fixed prices for unknown future work is a tough ask. They always want to quote it fresh.

**Sarah:** Then you create a hierarchy. Fixed rates are plan A. Competitive quotes are plan B. Time and materials is the absolute last resort, and it must have a not-to-exceed cap. You also define approval authorities. Your site manager can approve up to £5k, you can approve up to £50k, anything above goes to the commercial director. Clear boundaries stop delays and unauthorised spending.

**Mike:** That makes sense. It puts a formal system around the chaos. Okay, what about point two? Managing the suppliers themselves. I have strategic partners I’ve worked with for a decade. When they submit a change order price that feels high, how do I push back without destroying that long-term relationship?

**Sarah:** This is where you have to separate the commercial negotiation from the strategic relationship. You stick to the contract. The process is the process, for everyone. You demand a detailed cost breakdown, just like you would on an initial tender. Labour hours, material invoices, subcontractor quotes, overhead, profit. You audit it.

**Mike:** So I ask them to justify every line item?

**Sarah:** Every single one. Ask the hard questions. 'Why does this need new tooling?' 'Are these labour hours realistic for the scope?' 'Show me the invoice for that expedited freight.' For a strategic partner, you can frame it as collaboration—'Help me understand these costs so I can get this approved internally.' For a transactional supplier, it’s simpler: 'This is what the contract requires.' Your job is to be a change order auditor, not just a processor.

**Mike:** That’s a good mindset shift. It’s about process, not personality. So, what about the final point—data and tech? I’ve got enough software to run a space mission. What’s actually going to help here?

**Sarah:** It’s not about buying more software, it’s about using it to enforce the process we just talked about. A good system automates the workflow. A change gets submitted, and it’s automatically routed to the right person based on the value. It creates a digital audit trail that you can defend with the client and in any disputes. No more lost emails or ‘he said, she said’ arguments.

**Mike:** So it’s about speed and accountability.

**Sarah:** Precisely. And more importantly, it gives you data. After six months, you can pull a report and see that 70% of your change order costs are coming from one subcontractor, or that a certain type of change is happening on every project. That data is gold. It tells you where the systemic problems are. It’s not about blaming people; it's about fixing the root cause, whether it's poor design information or a weak link in your supply chain.

### **Wrap-up (30 seconds)**

**Mike:** Right, so let me get this straight. Three key takeaways. One: embed a rigid change process into your contracts from the very beginning—pricing, approvals, the lot. Two: audit every change order like it’s a new tender—demand the cost breakdown. And three: use simple digital workflows to enforce the process and collect data to spot negative patterns early.

**Sarah:** That’s it exactly. You transform change orders from unpredictable threats into controlled, measurable business events. You protect your budget, you hold your partners accountable, and you keep the project moving.
