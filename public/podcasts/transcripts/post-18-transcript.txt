**(Podcast intro music with a solid, confident beat fades in and then fades to a low background hum)**

**Sarah:** Right, let's get straight into it. You’re on site, the programme is tight, and then it comes in: a change request. A small one, you think. But that ‘small’ change snowballs, the schedule slips, costs blow out, and suddenly you’re in firefighting mode. Sound familiar?

**Mike:** All too familiar, Sarah. We had a project last quarter where a seemingly minor tweak to a curtain wall fixing detail, signed off on a handshake, ended up costing us a three-week delay and a nasty argument with the architect. The ripple effect was immense. It’s a constant headache.

**Sarah:** Exactly. I’m Sarah King, and I spend my days researching efficiency on major construction projects. With me is Mike Davies, an operations manager at a tier 1 contractor who lives this reality every day.

**Mike:** That’s me. And honestly, I need a better way to handle this.

**Sarah:** Good. Because today, we’re cutting the jargon and talking about one thing: why your change control process must match the impact of the change. We’ll cover how to categorise changes so you're not using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, how to tailor the process for each type, and how to avoid the common pitfalls that derail projects.

**(Background music fades out completely)**

**Sarah:** Mike, your curtain wall example is perfect. The core problem is that most firms have one change process, and it’s usually slow and bureaucratic. So, the site teams try to bypass it for the ‘small stuff’, and that’s when things go pear-shaped.

**Mike:** One hundred percent. The official process is a 10-page form and a two-week approval cycle. Nobody has time for that when a subbie needs an answer *now*. So you make a call on the ground, and half the time it works, but when it doesn't... it's a disaster.

**Sarah:** This is the key. You shouldn't have one process. You need three. Think of it as low, medium, and high impact. Not all changes are created equal.

**Mike:** Okay, break that down for me. What’s a low-impact change in the real world?

**Sarah:** A low-impact change is a minor revision with almost zero risk. A change to a paint colour in a non-client-facing area. Swapping a specified door handle for an equivalent, approved alternative because of a supply issue. These are things that can be approved by the site manager on the spot with a simple, standardised, one-line entry into a change log. Quick, documented, done. No committee meeting needed.

**Mike:** I like that. It empowers the site team but keeps a record. So, what’s medium?

**Sarah:** Medium-impact changes have a moderate scope. Maybe you’re adding a few extra partition walls that weren't on the original drawing. It affects the schedule, involves a variation order for the dry-lining subbie, and needs a bit more checking. This requires a proper change request form, but it should be simple. It needs sign-off from the commercial manager and maybe the project manager. It needs a clear cost and a 24-hour turnaround, not two weeks.

**Mike:** Right, that’s where we often get stuck. The process is too heavy for that kind of thing. So, high impact must be the big, scary ones?

**Sarah:** Precisely. These are the project-killers if you get them wrong. A change to the structural steel design after fabrication has started. A complete redesign of the M&E system on a hospital project. This is where you bring out the ‘bureaucracy’, because here, it’s not bureaucracy—it’s essential risk management.

**Mike:** Okay, so for a high-impact change, what does that process look like?

**Sarah:** This is the full works. A detailed impact assessment: what’s the effect on cost, schedule, safety, and quality? It needs a multi-level approval process involving the client, the lead designer, and your own senior management. It requires a full risk assessment and, crucially, a detailed plan for rework and integration. You need to war-game it. What happens if this goes wrong? How do we recover?

**Mike:** The problem is, getting buy-in for this from the top down is tough. They just want us to build faster and cheaper. They see this kind of planning as slowing things down.

**Sarah:** You have to reframe it. This isn't about slowing things down; it's about preventing a catastrophic stop. By having a streamlined process for low and medium changes, you’re actually accelerating 90% of the changes that come through. You’re banking that time. That gives you the breathing room—and the credibility—to say, "Stop. This one is different. This one is high-risk, and we need to follow the full process to protect the entire project."

**Mike:** That makes sense. You’re trading a bit of discipline on the small stuff for robust control over the big stuff. And having clear definitions stops the arguments about what’s a big deal and what isn't.

**Sarah:** Exactly. You establish clear roles. The site manager owns low-impact changes. The PM and commercial manager own medium. A formal change board owns high. You standardise the forms for each level. And you train your teams so everyone knows the rules of the game. It takes the emotion and guesswork out of it.

**Mike:** Right. So, the biggest takeaway for me is to stop thinking of ‘the’ change process and start thinking of three distinct, tiered processes.

**Sarah:** That’s it. One, categorise every single change request: low, medium, or high impact. No exceptions. Two, match the process to the category. A one-liner for low, a one-pager for medium, and a full-on review for high.

**Mike:** My first step is to sit down with my commercial manager and define those categories for our projects. Simple, clear, non-negotiable definitions.

**Sarah:** That’s the perfect place to start. Get that right, and you'll spend less time firefighting and more time building.

**(Podcast outro music fades in)**

**Sarah:** That's all we have time for today. Thanks, Mike.

**Mike:** Cheers, Sarah. That was genuinely useful.
