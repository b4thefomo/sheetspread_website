**Hook**

**Sarah:** Change orders. They’re the single biggest source of arguments, budget blowouts, and legal headaches on any major project. Most contractors see them as an unavoidable cost of doing business. But they’re not. 80% of the disputes that burn your time and margin can be prevented. And it starts with a 20-minute meeting.

**Intro**

**Mike:** Right. Welcome to Project Unpacked. I’m Mike, I run operations for a tier one main contractor. And that’s Sarah, a research analyst who spends her days figuring out why projects like mine go wrong. Sarah, good to have you.

**Sarah:** Good to be here, Mike.

**Mike:** So, a 20-minute meeting. Sounds a bit too good to be true. On our sites, a meeting about a simple variation can drag on for hours. What are we actually going to talk about today?

**Sarah:** No theory. Just a practical framework. We’ll cover why this isn't just another meeting, the crucial prep work that makes it effective, how to run the meeting itself, and the non-negotiable follow-up that protects you from disputes. Straight to it.

**Main Discussion**

**Mike:** Okay, let's start there. Why does this work? In my world, change orders come from unclear drawings or clients changing their mind last minute. A meeting can’t fix a bad set of specs.

**Sarah:** It can’t fix the specs, but it can fix the *communication* around them. That’s the root of the problem. A client sees a minor alteration; you see a major impact on programme and cost. The dispute isn't about the change itself, it's about the unmanaged expectation gap. This meeting is designed to kill that gap before it even exists.

**Mike:** Right, so it's pre-emptive. You’re saying the real work happens *before* the 20 minutes?

**Sarah:** Exactly. This isn't a casual catch-up. Before you even invite the client, your team sends out a brutally simple agenda. One page. You attach a clear summary of the current scope, and—this is the most important part—you proactively identify potential areas for change.

**Mike:** Give me a real-world example.

**Sarah:** Let's say you're doing a facade package. The spec is for a specific aluminium cladding. In your pre-meeting pack, you state: 'The agreed specification is XYZ. Any deviation to a different finish or profile will incur an estimated cost of £X per square metre and add Y weeks to the procurement lead time.' You front-load the difficult conversation. You’re not surprising them with a bill later; you’re giving them the commercial data to make an informed decision now.

**Mike:** I see. You’re making the consequences of change crystal clear from the outset. So, we've done the prep. We’re in the room with the client. How do we keep this to 20 minutes? My project managers would struggle with that.

**Sarah:** It’s about aggressive time management. The structure is rigid.
*   **First 5 minutes:** You review the project status. No waffle. 'We are here on the programme. These are the upcoming milestones.'
*   **Next 10 minutes:** You go through those potential changes you flagged in the agenda. Point to the drawing, use a visual. Don't say 'the fenestration detail'; say 'this window junction right here.' For each point, you ask a direct question: 'Are we proceeding as per the agreed spec, or do you want to explore an alternative?'
*   **Final 5 minutes:** This is for confirmation. You verbally summarise the decisions. 'So, to confirm, we're proceeding with the standard cladding, and we will investigate the cost for the alternative door hardware. Correct?' You need a clear 'yes' from the decision-maker in the room.

**Mike:** A verbal 'yes' is one thing. But when my commercial team submits the invoice a month later, memories get hazy. What’s the follow-up?

**Sarah:** This is the cornerstone. If you don't do this, the meeting was a waste of time. Within an hour of the meeting finishing, a one-page summary email goes out. It's not lengthy minutes; it's a list of bullet points:
*   'Item 1: Cladding. Decision: Proceed with specified material.'
*   'Item 2: Door Hardware. Action: Contractor to provide cost for alternative by [Date].'

That email acts as the record. It's simple, immediate, and incredibly difficult to dispute later. You attach it to the formal record. It becomes your evidence.

**Mike:** What if the change is genuinely complex? A 20-minute chat isn't going to solve a major structural redesign.

**Sarah:** Of course not. And it’s not meant to. For complex issues, this meeting serves as a formal *triage*. The outcome isn't the final solution; the outcome is the documented agreement *to instruct a change* and to approve the cost of investigating it further. It stops the 'I just asked you to look into it' argument, which is where so many disputes begin. It establishes the commercial starting line.

**Wrap-up**

**Mike:** Okay, that makes sense. So, it's not really about the 20-minute meeting itself. It’s a disciplined process: Proactively warn of the commercial impact, meet efficiently to get a decision, and then document that decision immediately.

**Sarah:** Precisely. It’s about shifting from a reactive 'deal with the dispute' mindset to a proactive 'prevent the dispute' one. It’s 20 minutes of focused, sometimes uncomfortable, conversation to save yourself 80 hours of arguments and paperwork down the line. The maths is simple.

**Mike:** The maths is simple. Sarah, that’s genuinely useful. Thanks for breaking it down. That’s all for this episode of Project Unpacked.
