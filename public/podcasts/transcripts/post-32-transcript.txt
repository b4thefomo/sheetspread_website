**Sarah:** Welcome to "Site Level," the podcast that cuts through the management jargon to give you practical insights for the construction industry. I'm Sarah Clarke, a researcher focused on project delivery.

**Mike:** And I'm Mike Davies, an Operations Manager for a tier 1 contractor. My job is to make sure projects actually get built, not just talked about.

**Sarah:** Right. And today we're tackling a massive headache on site: figuring out who is supposed to be doing what. We’ve all seen it – a critical task gets missed, two teams do the same work, and the blame game starts.

**Mike:** It’s a classic. The consultant blames the subbie, the subbie blames the PM, and everyone’s pointing fingers while the schedule slips. It’s a mess.

**Sarah:** Exactly. So, for the next four minutes, we are going to break down a simple tool to kill that confusion for good: the RACI matrix. We'll cover what it is in plain English, how you can actually use it on a live project without creating a mountain of paperwork, and the single biggest mistake people make when they try.

**(Short transition sound effect)**

**Mike:** Okay Sarah, let's get straight to it. RACI. I've seen the acronym in tender documents and corporate presentations, but on the ground, what is it and why should I care?

**Sarah:** Think of it as a one-page instruction manual for your team. It answers the four most important questions for any task. R-A-C-I. R is for **Responsible**. This is the person or team with their hands on the tools, the one actually *doing* the work. Pouring the concrete, installing the glazing, whatever it is.

**Mike:** The ‘doer’. Got it. Simple enough.

**Sarah:** A is for **Accountable**. This is the critical one, Mike, and where it usually goes wrong. This is the one person whose neck is on the line. They own the outcome. They aren't necessarily doing the work, but they are the final authority and have the yes/no vote. On a project, this is often the Project Manager for a specific package.

**Mike:** Right, so the Responsible person does the work, the Accountable person owns the result. What's the biggest mistake you mentioned?

**Sarah:** Assigning more than one ‘A’. You can only have one person Accountable. The minute you have two, you have zero. If everyone is accountable, no one is. It creates confusion and lets people pass the buck. One task, one owner. Non-negotiable.

**Mike:** I can see that. We get a lot of ‘design by committee’ issues where everyone has an opinion but no one makes the final call. So, what about C and I?

**Sarah:** C is for **Consulted**. These are your experts. The structural engineer you need to check a drawing with, or the health and safety advisor you need to review a RAMS document. You need their input *before* the work is done. It’s a two-way conversation.

**Mike:** Okay, so people whose advice you need. And I?

**Sarah:** I is for **Informed**. These people just need to be kept in the loop. It's a one-way street. You email them the update, you tell them the steel frame is complete. They don't have a say, but they need to know for their own work. Think of the commercial manager who needs to know a milestone is hit for invoicing, or the client who just wants a progress report.

**Mike:** That makes sense. Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed. So how do I put this into practice on a busy site without my team rolling their eyes at another spreadsheet?

**Sarah:** Don’t make it a massive, complex document. That’s the second biggest mistake. Keep it high-level. At the start of a new phase or work package, get the site manager, the engineer, the commercial lead, and the main subcontractor in a room for 30 minutes.

**Mike:** A 30-minute meeting? That's a big ask.

**Sarah:** It will save you 10 hours of arguments later. You list the 10-15 critical activities for that phase on a whiteboard. Approving final drawings. Sign-off on foundations. Procuring key materials. Then, for each one, you go around the room and agree on one 'R' and one 'A'. That's it. The C and I will usually be obvious from there.

**Mike:** So the value is in the conversation itself, not just the finished chart. It forces everyone to agree upfront who owns what.

**Sarah:** Precisely. You’re forcing clarity. For instance, the task is ‘Final Sign-off on M&E Drawings’. The M&E consultant is Responsible for producing them. But who is Accountable for the final sign-off that allows fabrication to start? Is it the Project Director? The Design Manager? Deciding that in a room, together, prevents a two-week delay down the line when everyone thought someone else was handling it.

**Mike:** I see it. It moves the argument from the middle of the project, when you’re on fire, to the beginning, when you can actually plan for it.

**Sarah:** You’ve hit the nail on the head. It's a conflict prevention tool, not a bureaucratic exercise.

**(Short transition sound effect)**

**Mike:** Okay, so to wrap this up, what are the key takeaways for an ops manager like me? If I do nothing else, what should I remember?

**Sarah:** Three things. One: For any critical task, make sure there is only one person Accountable. One owner. This is the golden rule.

**Mike:** One owner. Got it.

**Sarah:** Two: Don’t just email a spreadsheet. The power is in the collaborative process of building it. Get the key people together and force the discussion.

**Mike:** Make them talk to each other. Makes sense.

**Sarah:** And three: Keep it simple. Don't RACI every tiny task. Focus on the major deliverables, the interfaces between trades, and the key project milestones. That’s where the real risk is.

**Mike:** Right. Focus on the big rocks. Cheers, Sarah. That’s actually useful. I’m going to try this with the project team for the groundworks package on our new city centre job. See if we can avoid the usual chaos.

**Sarah:** Good. Let me know how it goes. That’s all we have time for on "Site Level." Join us next time.
