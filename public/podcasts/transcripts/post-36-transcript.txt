**Sarah:** Right, let’s get straight into it. Mike, another week on a major project. What’s the biggest headache?

**Mike:** Same as last week, Sarah. Change orders. We had a client demanding to know the cost impact of a spec change from three weeks ago. My project manager spent half a day digging through a hundred emails and three different spreadsheets to find the answer. It’s organised chaos at best, and a financial black hole at worst.

**Sarah:** That’s the classic symptom. You're not fighting the change order itself; you’re fighting a data problem. It's a complete lack of visibility, and it’s costing you time, money, and client trust.

**Mike:** Exactly. So what’s the fix?

**Sarah:** Today, we're cutting through the noise and talking about one thing: getting control of change orders using dashboards. We’ll cover what a *good* dashboard actually looks like, the specific metrics you absolutely have to track, and how to make it work on-site without just creating more admin for the team.

**Mike:** Okay, so a dashboard. I’ve seen plenty of them. Most are just a mess of charts that look impressive but tell you nothing. What makes a change order dashboard actually useful for an Ops Manager like me?

**Sarah:** The difference is moving from a collection of documents to a single source of truth. Forget sifting through emails. A proper dashboard gives you a live, consolidated view of every single change. It's the project's navigation chart. At a glance, anyone from the client to the commercial team can see the impact on budget and schedule.

**Mike:** So, in theory, when that client calls, my PM can pull up the dashboard and give them a straight answer in 30 seconds, not three hours.

**Sarah:** Precisely. But that only works if you’re tracking the right things. Too much data is as useless as too little.

**Mike:** Alright, give me the essentials. If I’m building this from scratch, what are the non-negotiable metrics I need on there?

**Sarah:** There are five critical ones. First, **Total Cost of Change Orders** – the big number everyone cares about. Second, the **Impact on Project Schedule** in days. This is the one that really gets a client's attention. Third, the **Number of Open vs. Closed Change Orders**. This shows you your backlog and potential bottlenecks.

**Mike:** That’s a good start. What else?

**Sarah:** Fourth, and this is crucial for your team's efficiency: **Average Time to Approval**. If it’s taking you 20 days to get a signature, you’ve got a process problem, not a construction problem. And finally, a simple pie chart showing the **Status of All Orders**: pending, approved, rejected. It’s an instant health check.

**Mike:** The ‘Time to Approval’ one is huge. That’s a metric I can take to the board to justify a better system. But what about the design? My site managers won't use something that looks like an aeroplane cockpit. It needs to be simple.

**Sarah:** Absolutely. Simplicity is key. Use clear colour-coding. Red for overdue or rejected. Amber for pending. Green for approved. A senior manager should be able to understand the project’s change order status in five seconds flat, just from the colours. Use bar charts for costs, and a simple number for schedule delays. No complexity.

**Mike:** Okay, that makes sense. But a dashboard is useless if the process behind it is broken. We can have the best-looking chart in the world, but if the team is still using email to submit requests, the data is going to be garbage.

**Sarah:** You’ve hit the nail on the head. The technology is just an enabler; the process is the foundation. You need a formal, documented change order workflow. Request, review, approve, implement. That’s it. Some of the best-run projects I’ve seen use a formal Change Control Board – key stakeholders who meet weekly to rule on all changes. It forces discipline and accountability.

**Mike:** A Change Control Board… the commercial director would love that. It takes the arguments out of email chains and into a formal meeting. My final question is about integration. We live in Procore. We’re not going to adopt another standalone system that doesn’t talk to it. Does this have to be a separate platform?

**Sarah:** No, and it shouldn't be. For this to work, it has to be integrated. Your dashboard should pull data directly from your existing project management system. The goal is to eliminate manual data entry entirely. If a change order is updated in your PM software, the dashboard should reflect that in real-time. It kills errors and saves hundreds of man-hours.

---

**Sarah:** Right, let’s wrap this up. Mike, from our chat, what’s the one immediate action you’re going to take?

**Mike:** It’s defining those five key metrics you mentioned. We’re currently trying to track everything and achieving nothing. I’m going back to my team and saying, "We will track total cost, schedule impact, open/closed status, and approval time. Nothing else matters for now." Get that right first.

**Sarah:** Perfect. That’s the takeaway. Don’t boil the ocean. Define your critical metrics, build a dead-simple, visual dashboard that plugs into your current system, and hammer home the process behind it. That is how you turn change order chaos into control.
