**Sarah:** Mike, you’ve been in operations at a Tier 1 for what, fifteen years now?

**Mike:** Nearer twenty, Sarah. And in that time, I’ve sat through more project review meetings than I care to remember.

**Sarah:** Let me guess. Most of them are a post-mortem. A forty-slide PowerPoint deck explaining in excruciating detail why the programme has slipped or why the costs are running away. It’s all reactive.

**Mike:** Death by spreadsheet. You’ve hit the nail on the head. We’re great at reporting on what’s already gone wrong. We’re not so good at seeing it coming.

**Sarah:** Well, that’s exactly what we’re cutting through today. I’m Sarah, a construction research analyst.

**Mike:** And I’m Mike, an Operations Manager.

**Sarah:** Today we’re talking about your review cadence – that weekly rhythm of meetings. We’re going to discuss how to turn them from a box-ticking exercise into a predictive tool. We’ll cover choosing the right KPIs, spotting dangerous patterns in the data, and crucially, turning those observations into actions that protect your margin.

**Mike:** Sounds good. Less reporting, more fixing. I'm all for it.

**Sarah:** Right, let's get straight into it. The blog post calls it ‘Governance Cadence’. In simple terms, it's the non-negotiable rhythm of your reviews. Not just having the meeting, but having it in a structured way, every single week, looking at the same core metrics.

**Mike:** Okay, I get that. Consistency is key. But which metrics? My desk is flooded with data. Cost vs Value, labour productivity, material waste, safety observations, RFIs… you can track a hundred different things. Most of it is just noise. What actually matters?

**Sarah:** That’s the critical first step. You need to stop tracking everything and focus on the vital few. For a project manager on site, I'd argue for five, max. One, a leading safety indicator, like near-miss reports, not just LTIs after someone’s been hurt. Two, your Schedule Performance Index, or SPI – are you delivering the planned work? Three, cost performance – your planned cost versus your actual cost for completed work. Four, productivity – measured in man-hours per unit, whether that's metres of pipe laid or square metres of concrete poured. And finally, the status of critical client change orders.

**Mike:** Right, that makes sense. A tight dashboard. We have dashboards, of course. Everything is Red, Amber, Green. The problem is, by the time something goes red, the damage is done. The money is spent, the delay is baked in. How does looking at this weekly help me see a problem *before* it happens?

**Sarah:** This is the core of it. You’re not just looking at a snapshot. You’re looking for the pattern week-on-week. The dashboard doesn't give you the answer; it tells you where to ask the question. For example, your productivity KPI for the M&E contractor is green on Monday and Tuesday, then dips to amber every Wednesday afternoon for the past three weeks. That’s not a random event, that’s a pattern.

**Mike:** And that pattern is the clue. The dashboard has flagged the ‘what’ – productivity is dropping. My job in that weekly review is to find the ‘why’.

**Sarah:** Exactly. Why is it always Wednesday? Is that when they get a new delivery of materials that clogs up the laydown area? Is there a clash with another trade’s activity? Is a specific supervisor always off-site that afternoon? The data points to the problem; your operational knowledge has to solve it.

**Mike:** So, in the review, instead of just noting ‘M&E productivity is amber’, the conversation has to be: ‘We’ve seen this pattern for three weeks. The root cause is a recurring logistics clash with the drywall delivery. The action is for the project manager to reschedule one of those deliveries to the morning. We will review the productivity numbers next Thursday to see if it’s fixed.’

**Sarah:** Precisely. You’ve moved from passive reporting to active, proactive problem-solving. It's the difference between being a historian of your project and being its captain. Another example: you see a sudden spike in RFIs from the steelwork subcontractor. It’s an anomaly, not a pattern. That’s a massive red flag. It likely means there's a serious issue with the design information they’ve been issued.

**Mike:** And if you catch that on a Tuesday, you can get the design team on it immediately. If you wait for the monthly review, they’ve already lost two weeks of fabrication time, and you’re facing a major delay claim.

**Sarah:** This is where technology helps, but it doesn't replace the manager. You use systems like Procore or Asite to automate the data collection and visualisation – the ‘what’. But the ‘why’ and the ‘what next’ still require human intelligence and a conversation. The whole point of the weekly cadence is to make that conversation happen quickly and effectively.

**Mike:** It’s a shift in mindset. The meeting isn't about filling in the report. The meeting is a problem-solving workshop, triggered by the data.

---

**Sarah:** Exactly. So, to wrap this up, what are the key, no-nonsense takeaways for an Ops Manager like yourself?

**Mike:** For me, it’s simple. First, I’m going to review our standard project dashboards. Are we tracking those vital few KPIs or just creating noise? I suspect it's the latter.

**Sarah:** Good first step. What else?

**Mike:** Second, I’m changing the main question in our weekly reviews. It's no longer 'What's the status?'. It's 'What patterns or anomalies is this data showing us from last week?'

**Sarah:** And the follow-up?

**Mike:** The follow-up is mandatory: 'What is the root cause, and what specific action are we taking *before* next week’s meeting to fix it?'. That action, with a name and a date against it, goes into the minutes. No more 'we'll monitor the situation'.

**Sarah:** Perfect. That's how you turn data into profit margin. It's about building a relentless rhythm of identifying and solving problems before they escalate.

**Mike:** Straightforward and actionable. Thanks, Sarah.

**Sarah:** Any time, Mike.
