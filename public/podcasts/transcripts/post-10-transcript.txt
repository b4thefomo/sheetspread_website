**(Podcast Intro Music - upbeat, professional, fades after 5 seconds)**

**Sarah:** Change orders. They’re the one constant on every project, but they’re also where profit, schedule, and relationships go to die. We’ve all seen a tidy project get dragged into chaos by a poorly managed change.

**Mike:** It’s a nightmare, Sarah. You get a notice on a Friday afternoon and you can just feel the margin evaporating. It’s the endless back-and-forth, the arguments over pennies, and the delays that kill you. We need a better way.

**Sarah:** Exactly. And that’s what we’re tackling today. This isn't theoretical. We're giving you the direct, no-nonsense playbook to get control. We'll cover three critical areas: getting the rules right in the contract, a bulletproof workflow that actually works on site, and the hard truths about pricing and documentation.

**Mike:** Good. No fluff, just what works. Let’s get into it.

**(Short musical sting)**

**Mike:** Right, let’s start at the beginning. The contract. I’ve inherited jobs where the change clauses are so vague they’re useless. What are the absolute non-negotiables we need baked in from day one to avoid arguments later?

**Sarah:** Your best leverage is before you ever mobilise. If it's not in the contract, it's just a debate. You need three things, crystal clear. First, a **pricing hierarchy**. Mandate that pre-agreed unit rates are used first. If not, then a lump sum. Time and Materials, or T&M, is the absolute last resort, and it must have a ‘not-to-exceed’ cap.

**Mike:** That stops the blank cheque problem with T&M. What’s second?

**Sarah:** **Allowable markups**. Define them. Explicitly state the percentage for overhead and profit, for you and for your subcontractors. No ambiguity. This prevents markup-on-markup stacking that drives clients mad and makes you look greedy.

**Mike:** And the third?

**Sarah:** **Notice periods and documentation standards**. Contractor has 7 days to provide notice with a preliminary impact. The final proposal must include daily timecards, material invoices, and a schedule fragnet for any time extension request. If they don’t provide the backup, you don’t pay. It forces discipline.

**Mike:** Okay, that’s solid. Contract sorted. But then it hits the site and the process falls apart. Emails, verbal directions, RFIs that go unanswered for weeks. How do we stop that chaos?

**Sarah:** You need a rigid, time-bound workflow. Don’t let anything slip. It’s four steps. **One: Identify & Log.** The second an issue appears, it gets a number in a change log. No exceptions. **Two: Price Request.** You issue a formal request for pricing with a deadline.

**Mike:** That’s where it gets slow. We send a price, then hear nothing.

**Sarah:** That’s why the client’s side needs step three: **Independent Check.** Their QS or CM must produce their own estimate and schedule review within, say, five working days. This isn't about beating you up; it's about having a data-driven starting point for the negotiation instead of just reacting to your number.

**Mike:** So we’re comparing a detailed estimate to another detailed estimate, not a lump sum to a guess. Makes sense. And the last step?

**Sarah:** **Authorisation with conditions.** The change is approved, or you get a limited, not-to-exceed authorisation to proceed with the urgent parts while the final price is agreed. The key is that every step has a deadline. Lags are where costs explode and claims are born.

**Mike:** Right, let’s talk about that independent check and the documentation. That’s the friction point. We submit our costs, and the client picks them apart. What’s the minimum viable evidence we need to provide to make our costs undeniable?

**Sarah:** It’s about making it bulletproof. For labour, it’s daily T&M tickets, signed on the day by their site rep. Not a week later from memory. For materials, it’s the actual supplier quotes and delivery tickets. For equipment, it’s the rental invoice. There’s no room for debate.

**Mike:** And the schedule? The "it'll take five extra days" argument?

**Sarah:** That’s the biggest one. You must provide a simple CPM fragnet. It’s a mini-schedule showing how the new work logically ties into the existing critical path and consumes float. No fragnet, no time extension. It forces your planner to prove the delay, not just claim it. And for every change, add a one-paragraph ‘narrative of impact’—what happened, what it affects, what was done to mitigate it.

**Mike:** That narrative is smart. It tells the story for the executive who has to sign the cheque later.

**Sarah:** Precisely. It turns a list of costs into a clear business case.

**(Short musical sting)**

**Sarah:** So, let's wrap this up with the key takeaways. Mike, from your perspective on the ground, what’s the one thing you’d tell every Ops Manager?

**Mike:** It’s the discipline on site. That five-minute huddle between your super and their rep at the end of each day to sign off the T&M tickets. It seems small, but it prevents 90% of the arguments down the line. Get the facts agreed when they happen, not weeks later in an office.

**Sarah:** Spot on. And from my side, it’s this: Treat change orders like controlled investments, not emergencies. That means three things: One, define the rules upfront in the contract. Two, run a disciplined, time-bound workflow for every single change. And three, demand data—signed tickets, quotes, and a fragnet—to justify every pound and every day.

**Mike:** Get that right, and you’re back in control.

**Sarah:** Exactly. You’re protecting value, not just processing paperwork.
