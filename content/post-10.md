7 tips from clients about change orders


<p><b>Change Order Management From a Client’s Perspective: The Complete Playbook</b></p>

<p>Change orders are inevitable in construction, but they don’t have to derail budgets or schedules. This guide shows owners and client-side teams how to manage change orders proactively—from setting the rules in your contracts to pricing, negotiation, documentation, and dispute avoidance. By following a clear, data-driven process, you can protect value, preserve relationships, and keep your project on course.</p>

<p><b>What a Change Order Really Is (and Why It Matters to Clients)</b></p>

<p>A change order is a formal modification to the contract scope, price, time, or a combination of those. From a client’s perspective, the key is not just “signing the paper,” but controlling three risks: scope creep (what exactly is changing), cost growth (how much more you pay), and delay (how the schedule is impacted). Treating change orders as controlled investments rather than surprises will transform outcomes.</p>

<p><b>Why Change Orders Happen: Root Causes You Can Anticipate</b></p>

<p>Most changes fall into recurring categories: design development and coordination gaps, unforeseen site conditions, code or authority requirements, supply chain disruptions and substitutions, client-driven enhancements, and value engineering opportunities. Anticipating these drivers allows you to plan contingencies, define unit rates, and set a fast pathway for approvals so the project keeps moving without runaway spend.</p>

<p><b>Set the Rules Upfront: Contract Terms That Protect the Client</b></p>

<p>Your best leverage is before mobilization. Bake change management into the contract so everyone plays by known rules. Consider clauses that:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Define change</i>: Clear thresholds for what requires a formal change versus a field directive.</li>
<li><i>Notice requirements</i>: Contractor must notify within a set number of days with preliminary cost and time impact.</li>
<li><i>Pricing methodologies</i>: Hierarchy of pricing—pre-agreed unit rates first, then lump sum, then time and materials with caps.</li>
<li><i>Allowable markups</i>: Transparent labor burden components and caps on overhead and profit, including for subcontractors and tiers.</li>
<li><i>Documentation standards</i>: Timecards, material invoices, equipment rates, and schedule fragnet for any time request.</li>
<li><i>Time extensions</i>: Basis for entitlement, float ownership, and concurrency handling.</li>
<li><i>Audit rights</i>: Owner ability to verify backup and books for T&amp;M changes.</li>
<li><i>Dispute ladder</i>: Early neutral evaluation, mediation, or a dispute review board to resolve issues without litigation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Establishing these guardrails reduces debates, shortens cycle time, and produces consistent, defensible outcomes when auditors or stakeholders ask hard questions.</p>

<p><b>Build a Robust Change Control Workflow</b></p>

<p>A disciplined workflow prevents rework and re-pricing chaos. A practical client-side process is:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Identification</b>: Event logged with a concise description, drawing references, and potential cost/schedule flags.</li>
<li><b>Clarification</b>: Issue an RFI or directive to define scope boundaries; gather affected trades early.</li>
<li><b>Pricing request</b>: Contractor submits a priced proposal with quantities, labor/equipment hours, material quotes, and schedule fragnet.</li>
<li><b>Independent check</b>: Owner’s QS/CM prepares an independent estimate and schedule impact review.</li>
<li><b>Negotiation</b>: Resolve scope inclusions/exclusions, quantities, and rates; consider options and alternates.</li>
<li><b>Authorization</b>: Approve a formal change order or issue a not-to-exceed authorization with conditions and time impact terms.</li>
<li><b>Implementation</b>: Incorporate into drawings, model, buyout, and short-interval plans; communicate to field crews.</li>
<li><b>Closeout</b>: Verify delivery, collect final backup, update the change log, budget, SOV, and schedule baseline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every step should be time-bound; long lags are where cost overruns and claims grow.</p>

<p><b>Pricing Fundamentals: How Clients Should Evaluate Costs</b></p>

<p>Owners benefit from a transparent, first-principles approach to pricing. Start with quantities and production rates, then check labor, material, equipment, and subcontractor costs. For labor, distinguish base wage, fringes, payroll taxes, and actual burden. For equipment, use contract rate schedules or published rental indices. For materials, request current supplier quotes.</p>

<p>Choose the right pricing method for the situation: lump sum when scope is well defined; pre-agreed unit rates when quantities vary; time-and-materials for emergencies or investigative work, but with not-to-exceed caps and daily signed tickets. Insist on consistent markup rules across all tiers and monitor cumulative markups when multiple subs are involved.</p>

<p><b>Accounting for Schedule and Indirect Costs</b></p>

<p>Beyond direct costs, evaluate time-related overhead and disruption. If a change adds work but does not shift the critical path, it may not warrant a time extension, though local inefficiencies may be recognized if proven. If it impacts the critical path, the contractor may be entitled to added general conditions (site management, supervision, temporary facilities). Require a CPM fragnet showing logic ties, impacted activities, and float consumption to substantiate time impacts.</p>

<p><b>Managing Contingencies, Allowances, and Escalation</b></p>

<p>Client-side teams should separate planned risk funds from scope growth. Use owner contingency for owner-driven scope changes; keep design contingency for incomplete design maturation in early phases. Track allowance drawdowns and reconcile to actual costs. When supply chain volatility is high, consider escalation clauses tied to recognized indices, or pre-buy critical materials to lock pricing and reduce change exposure.</p>

<p><b>Documentation That Protects the Client</b></p>

<p>Great documentation wins negotiations and avoids disputes. For each change, collect: redlined drawings or bulletins, RFI trail, daily reports highlighting impacted crews, dated photos, material quotes, supplier lead-time letters, delivery tickets, signed T&amp;M timesheets, and the CPM fragnet. Add a one-paragraph “narrative of impact” explaining cause, effect, and mitigation steps taken. Consistent files allow quick audits and faster executive approvals.</p>

<p><b>Digital Tools That Accelerate Change Order Management</b></p>

<p>Digitize the workflow so cost, scope, and schedule data are synchronized. A common data environment with structured forms, e-signatures, and version control keeps everyone aligned. Integrate the change log with the cost ledger and the master schedule so approved changes automatically update the budget and baseline. Use 4D/5D BIM snapshots to visually confirm scope and quantify impacts. Ensure all changes maintain an audit trail with time-stamped approvals.</p>

<p><b>Negotiation Playbook: Getting to Yes Without Overpaying</b></p>

<p>Effective negotiation is principled and data-driven. Ask for options that deliver the same intent at lower cost or time (alternate materials, prefabrication, resequencing). Use independent estimates as an anchor, and reconcile line-by-line, not lump sum versus lump sum. Bundle small changes to reduce administrative cost and markup stacking. Use conditional approvals—authorize procurement now, final price later based on competitive quotes or verified quantities. Keep a running tally of cumulative markups and apply contract caps consistently.</p>

<p><b>Value Engineering Without Value Erosion</b></p>

<p>When changes arise, pair them with value engineering alternates to keep net impacts down. Require that alternates meet performance and warranty criteria, not just first cost savings. Evaluate lifetime cost, maintainability, and energy implications. For complex systems, pilot mock-ups to validate that VE does not create downstream changes or commissioning headaches.</p>

<p><b>Schedule Impacts: Time Extensions, Float, and Acceleration</b></p>

<p>Time is money, but only if entitlement exists. Evaluate whether the change creates a new critical path or consumes available float. Clarify float ownership in the contract; absent express terms, treat float as a project resource, not a unilateral buffer. When time is lost, consider mitigation first: resequencing, adding shifts, or partial turnovers. If acceleration is owner-directed, define scope, cost basis (labor premiums, inefficiency), and success criteria. Avoid “constructive acceleration” by timely granting justified extensions or issuing clear directives with fair compensation.</p>

<p><b>Governance: Approvals, Limits, and Reporting</b></p>

<p>Establish approval thresholds that match risk. For example, the project manager can approve up to a defined dollar amount; larger changes require executive review. Hold weekly change meetings to clear bottlenecks, reconcile logs, and prepare decisions for the steering committee. Summarize current exposure (approved, pending, and potential changes), net budget impact, and schedule variance. Tie change exposure to contingency burn so leadership sees both runway and risk.</p>

<p><b>Preventing Disputes Through Early Warning and Collaboration</b></p>

<p>Most claims start as unresolved change issues. Create a culture of early warning: the contractor raises potential changes promptly, and the client responds quickly with direction. Use a dispute resolution ladder—project teams attempt resolution first, then senior negotiations, then mediation. For complex or long-duration projects, a standing dispute review board can deliver quick, non-binding recommendations that keep work moving while issues resolve.</p>

<p><b>A Practical Case Example: Unforeseen Underground Utilities</b></p>

<p>Midway through excavation, crews encounter undocumented utilities crossing the planned foundation. The contractor issues an early notice and stops work in the affected zone. The owner’s team convenes within 24 hours, issues an RFI to confirm as-built conflicts, and requests two priced options: reroute utilities or modify the foundation. The contractor provides T&amp;M investigative tickets and a fragnet showing a 7-day impact on the critical path.</p>

<p>The owner’s QS performs an independent estimate; resequencing nearby work absorbs two days of delay, reducing the net time extension to five days. A not-to-exceed authorization covers immediate utility relocation and procurement of fittings. Markups follow contract caps; daily T&amp;M tickets are signed by the owner’s rep. Weekly reviews reconcile quantities; final pricing settles under the NTE. The master schedule and budget baseline update within 48 hours of final approval, avoiding downstream surprises.</p>

<p><b>Field Controls: Making the Process Work on Site</b></p>

<p>On the ground, consistency beats heroics. Require foremen to tag work as “change” in daily logs and photos. Use pre-numbered T&amp;M tickets and train supervisors to capture labor classifications and start/stop times accurately. Ensure material delivery tickets reference the change number. A five-minute end-of-day huddle between the contractor’s superintendent and the owner’s field rep reconciles quantities and prevents week-late disputes.</p>

<p><b>Subcontractors and Tiered Markups</b></p>

<p>Client-side teams should scrutinize tiered pricing. Ensure subcontractor markups comply with contract terms and that prime contractor markups on sub work follow agreed caps. Watch for double-counting of supervision or small tools. Standardize what is included in general conditions versus direct work. For design-build or CM-at-Risk, use competitively bid unit rates where possible, and require at least two quotes for major material substitutions or specialty scopes.</p>

<p><b>Change Order KPIs and Continuous Improvement</b></p>

<p>Measure what matters to improve over time. Useful metrics include: number of change orders per million dollars of contract value; total change value as a percentage of original contract; average approval cycle time; percentage of changes approved before work starts; variance between contractor proposals and independent estimates; percentage of changes requiring time extensions; and the claim conversion rate (changes that escalate to disputes). Review trends monthly and adjust processes and staffing accordingly.</p>

<p><b>Training and Role Clarity</b></p>

<p>Even the best process fails without clear roles. Train project engineers on documentation standards, schedulers on fragnet development, and estimators on labor burden verification. Empower the project manager to negotiate within defined limits and escalate quickly when thresholds are exceeded. Create simple playbooks and checklists so replacements and new team members can maintain momentum without relearning the system mid-project.</p>

<p><b>Ethics, Transparency, and Relationship Management</b></p>

<p>Change orders can strain relationships if one party feels blindsided. Lead with transparency: share your independent estimate rationale, accept legitimate costs, and push back where evidence is thin. When both sides trust the process, disputes diminish and collaboration improves. Over the life of a program or portfolio, that trust often translates into better pricing, faster resolutions, and fewer claims.</p>
