      "title": "CHANGE ORDER FUNDAMENTALS & SCOPE DEFINITION",
      "points": [
        "Change orders represent formal modifications to original contract scope, schedule, or budget requiring documented approval processes",

      "points": [
        "Design gaps, unforeseen site conditions, and regulatory updates account for 70% of construction change orders",
        "Poor initial planning and inadequate site investigation create cascading change requirements throughout project lifecycle",

        "Unit-based pricing provides transparency while lump-sum pricing offers cost certainty for well-defined scope changes",
        "Time-and-materials pricing requires strict controls, daily reporting, and not-to-exceed limits to prevent cost overruns",
        "Competitive bidding for significant changes ensures fair market pricing and maintains vendor relationships"

      "points": [
        "Critical path analysis identifies which changes affect project completion dates and require schedule adjustments",
        "Float ownership definitions determine whether delays consume project buffer or trigger time extension requests",
        "Resource reallocation and acceleration strategies minimize schedule disruption while controlling additional costs"

        "Risk registers identify potential change drivers early, enabling proactive mitigation strategies and cost avoidance",
        "Insurance considerations include coverage for design errors, unforeseen conditions, and change-related delays"
