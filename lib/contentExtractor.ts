You are analyzing construction industry blog content to create slide takeaways. 

TASK: Extract the most important insights from this construction blog post and organize them into 3-5 content slides, with each slide containing exactly 3 key points maximum.

CONTENT TO ANALYZE:
Title: ${postTitle}

${postContent}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create 10-15 content slides for a comprehensive presentation
2. Break down the content into detailed, granular sections
3. Each slide should have 2-4 bullet points maximum
4. Each bullet point should be detailed and actionable (20-35 words)
5. Use construction industry terminology and professional language
6. Focus on practical, implementable insights with specific examples
7. Include methodology, implementation steps, best practices, and common pitfalls
8. Create slides for: Introduction, Problem Definition, Solutions, Implementation, Best Practices, Common Mistakes, Tools/Technology, Metrics, Case Studies, and Conclusions
9. Ensure comprehensive coverage of the topic with actionable depth

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "slides": [
    {
      "type": "content",
      "title": "SLIDE_TITLE_IN_UPPERCASE",
      "points": [
        "First key takeaway point",
        "Second key takeaway point", 
        "Third key takeaway point"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

EXAMPLES OF COMPREHENSIVE SLIDE TITLES:
- "CHANGE ORDER FUNDAMENTALS & SCOPE DEFINITION"
- "ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS & PREVENTION STRATEGIES"
