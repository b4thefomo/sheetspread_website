# SheetSpread Writing Style Guide

This guide outlines the writing style and approach for creating engaging, helpful content for the SheetSpread blog.

## Overall Writing Philosophy

SheetSpread content should feel like **a knowledgeable friend explaining tech** - professional but approachable, informative but not overwhelming. We're here to help people work smarter with their data, not impress them with jargon.

**Key Principles:**
- **Friendly, not stuffy** - Write like you're explaining to a colleague over coffee
- **Clear, not complex** - Simple language beats fancy words every time
- **Practical, not theoretical** - Focus on real solutions people can use today
- **Encouraging, not condescending** - Everyone starts somewhere with tech

## Writing Style Standards

### 1. Tone & Voice

**What We Sound Like:**
- **Conversational**: Use contractions (you're, it's, we'll)
- **Encouraging**: Celebrate small wins and progress
- **Direct**: Get to the point quickly, respect reader's time
- **Helpful**: Always thinking "how can I make this easier to understand?"

**What We Avoid:**
- Overly formal business speak ("leverage," "utilize," "synergize")
- Talking down to readers ("obviously," "simply," "just")
- Marketing fluff without substance
- Assuming expert-level knowledge

**Examples:**
- ‚ùå "Leverage SheetSpread to optimize your data workflows"
- ‚úÖ "Use SheetSpread to save hours on your weekly reports"

- ‚ùå "Simply configure the OAuth2 authentication protocol"
- ‚úÖ "Connect to Salesforce (we'll walk you through it step by step)"

### 2. Article Structure

#### **Intro Paragraph**
Hook readers immediately with the problem they're facing:
```
"Tired of copy-pasting Salesforce data into Google Sheets every Monday morning?
Let's fix that in the next 5 minutes."
```

#### **Body Content**
- **Short paragraphs** (2-4 sentences max)
- **Descriptive subheadings** that tell the story
- **Bulleted lists** for easy scanning
- **Real examples** that readers can relate to
- **Occasional personal touches** ("Here's my favorite trick...")

#### **Conclusion**
End with encouragement and a clear next step:
```
"That's it! You've just automated something that used to eat up hours of your week.
Ready to take it further? Check out our guide on..."
```

### 3. Headline Writing

**Format**: Make it benefit-focused and specific

**Good Headline Patterns:**
- "How to [Achieve Result] in [Specific Time]"
  - "How to Connect Salesforce to Google Sheets in 5 Minutes"

- "[Number] Ways to [Solve Problem]"
  - "5 Ways Sales Teams Use SheetSpread to Hit Their Numbers"

- "Stop [Pain Point]: [Better Solution]"
  - "Stop Exporting Manually: SheetSpread vs Manual Data Pulls"

**Avoid:**
- Clickbait ("This One Weird Trick...")
- Vague promises ("Transform Your Business")
- Overly technical jargon in headlines

### 4. Content Guidelines

#### **Language Style**
- **Use "you" and "we"** - Make it personal
- **Active voice** - "SheetSpread automates your reports" not "Reports are automated by SheetSpread"
- **Contractions** - "You're" instead of "you are"
- **Simple words** - "use" instead of "utilize", "help" instead of "facilitate"

#### **Technical Content**
- **Explain before using jargon** - First mention: "SOQL (Salesforce's query language)"
- **Use analogies** - "Think of SOQL like asking Salesforce specific questions"
- **Screenshots help** - But don't rely on them alone
- **Step numbers** - For tutorials, clear numbered steps

#### **Examples & Use Cases**
Always include concrete examples:
```
Instead of: "SheetSpread helps with reporting"
Use: "Imagine your weekly sales report updates automatically every Monday at 8am,
ready when you grab your morning coffee. That's SheetSpread."
```

### 5. Typography and Reading Experience

#### **Font Selection**
We use **Spectral** (serif font) for all blog content to create a friendly, readable experience:

```html

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Spectral:wght@300;400;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

**Font Weights:**
- **300 (Light)**: For subtle emphasis or captions
- **400 (Regular)**: Body text, paragraphs
- **600 (Semi-Bold)**: Subheadings, important callouts
- **700 (Bold)**: Main headings, strong emphasis

**Implementation:**
```css

  line-height: 1.7;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
}

/* Emphasis */

}
```

  color: #1a1a1a;       /* Soft black, easier on eyes */
}

.article-content a {
  color: #FF6600;       /* SheetSpread orange for links */
  text-decoration: underline;
}

.article-content code {

  <strong>üí° Pro Tip:</strong> This is a helpful insider trick that will save you time.
</div>
```

#### **Code Examples**
When showing queries or formulas, add context:

```markdown
Here's a SOQL query that grabs your leads from this week:

```soql
SELECT Id, FirstName, LastName, Company, Email
FROM Lead
WHERE CreatedDate = THIS_WEEK
```

This asks Salesforce: "Show me all leads created in the last 7 days."
```

#### **Quiz/Assessment Blocks**
Engage readers with self-assessment:

```html
<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e293b 0%, #334155 100%);
            border: 3px solid #FF6600;
            border-radius: 12px;
            padding: 28px;
            margin: 32px 0;">
  <h4 style="color: #FF6600;">ü§î Quick Check: Do You Need This?</h4>

    <li>Question 2?</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="color: #FEFCE8;"><strong>If you answered yes to 2+</strong>, keep reading...</p>
</div>
```

### 8. SEO & Links

#### **External Links**
Link to authoritative sources naturally:
- Official documentation (Google, Salesforce)

Always use descriptive anchor text:
- ‚ùå "Click here for more info"
- ‚úÖ "Check out Google's Sheets API documentation"
