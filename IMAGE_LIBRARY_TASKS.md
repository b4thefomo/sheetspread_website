## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (15 minutes)

### 1.1 Create Folder Structure
- [ ] Create `public/images/` directory if it doesn't exist
- [ ] Create `public/images/library/` subdirectory
- [ ] Verify folder permissions are correct
- [ ] Create `.gitkeep` file in library folder to preserve in git

**Command**:
```bash
mkdir -p public/images/library
touch public/images/library/.gitkeep
```

### 1.2 Create Data Directory
- [ ] Create `data/` directory in project root
- [ ] Create empty `image-metadata.json` file
- [ ] Initialize JSON with empty object `{}`
- [ ] Verify file is writable

**Command**:
```bash
mkdir -p data
echo '{}' > data/image-metadata.json
```

### 1.3 Upload Test Images

- [ ] Copy images to `public/images/library/`
- [ ] Verify images are accessible via file system

### 1.4 Update .gitignore
- [ ] Check if `data/image-metadata.json` should be in git (YES - it's generated metadata)
